# MESSAGE CATEGORIZATION SYSTEM PROJECT

## Project Overview
Message Categorization is an intelligent spam mail classifier developed using Logistic Regression techniques. 
The project aims to accurately classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam) based on their content. 
The dataset consists of thousands of labelled emails with two columns: "category" (spam or ham) and "message" (email content).


## Objectives
- Develop a model for spam classification using Logistic Regression.
- Preprocess the data by removing stop words and converting text into numerical features.
- Train the model on the labelled dataset using TF-IDF techniques.
- Achieve a high accuracy score of 96% on the test data.
- Classify new emails as spam or ham using the trained model.


## Features

- **Spam Classification:** Efficiently distinguishes between spam and ham emails.
- **Data Preprocessing** Removes stop words and converts text to numerical features.
- **TF-IDF Techniques:** Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction.
- **High Accuracy:** The model achieves a remarkable 96% accuracy score on the test dataset.
- **Real-time Classification:** Provides instant classification of new emails.
  

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Main programming language for backend development or model development. 
- **Scikit-learn:**  Library for machine learning tasks, including Logistic Regression and TF-IDF.
- **Pandas:**  Data manipulation library for dataset handling.
- **Numpy:** Library for numerical computations.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** Used for text preprocessing, including stop word removal.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Development environment for code execution and documentation.

## Challenges Faced

- **Data PreProcessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing the text data, including removing stop words, tokenization and converting to numerical features.
- **Imbalanced Data:** Ensuring that the model performs well despite potentially having more non-spam (ham) emails than spam emails.
- **Feature Engineering:** Determining the right features and how to represent the text data effectively for the model.
- **Overfitting:**  Avoid overfitting the model to the training data to ensure generalizability.
- **Model Interpretability:** Ensuring the model's decisions are understandable.

## Future Enhancements

- **Ensemble Techniques:** Explore ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for improved performance.
- **Deep Learning:** Explore deep learning models (e.g., LSTM) for more intricate text analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Experiment with different feature engineering techniques such as word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune model hyperparameters for better performance.
- **Real-time Classification:** Develop a web application where users can input emails to classify them in real time.
- **Multiclass Classification:** Extend the model to classify emails into multiple categories (e.g., promotions, personal, spam).


## Conclusion

The **Message Categorization System** successfully addresses the issue of spam emails using Logistic Regression. By preprocessing the data, training the model with TF-IDF techniques, and achieving a high accuracy score of 96%, SpamGuard provides a reliable solution for email classification. Future enhancements such as ensemble methods and user interface development could further elevate its effectiveness. SpamGuard serves as a practical tool for anyone seeking to manage and filter their email inbox efficiently.
